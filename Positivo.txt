Pretty sure within a week or two, supermarket supply chains will dry up as more counties are effected by Covid-19 (and possibly go into lockdown). If so, would the government introduce a form of rationing so that people can eat? Somehow I don't think so.
Supermarket workers are at the frontline of COVID-19.

Order online

Only get what you need / order what you need

Don't go outside to shop unless you promise to not panic buy.

Remember, all food has expire dates, and if you panic buy you waste a bunch of useful food.
There s plenty of food to go around during the pandemic say distributors despite panic buying across the Bay Area

We do not charge excessive prices in these times.

Stay safe, stay healthy and above all: Please take care of each other!

2 bottles 1000 kronen



Would work for loo rolls too...

End of day 1 of being unemployed thoughts: 

- what is a bra?

- will I be able to afford food after I  bored eat my stock.. probably not 

- i will never complain about work again

- i never want to hear the word #coronavirus again after all this. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk
i hope everyone is feeling well! its so important right now to self quarantine to ensure we arent endangering ourselves or anyone who cant handle this virus ?
Healthcare workers are fantastic! I would also like to give a shoutout to the lorry drivers (my hubby is one of them) who are working round the clock (7-day week) to get the food to the supermarkets. Please stop panic buying, more food is coming!

It's ironic that in order to survive you have to go shopping for food (unless you order online or telephone) which puts you at risk of getting the Covid-19 virus.

A dedicated shopping slot in all supermarkets for the over 70s on a regular basis seems an obvious idea to me. Not all have online options and if forced to isolate this is a way to let the shop in relative safety.

It stands to reason that investors think they're safe (or safer) buying U.S. government bonds. But the government, to finance new relief spending, is about to flood the market with...still more bonds. Translation: this over-supply will drive prices even lower
I'm seeing a lot of people who didn't have actual jobs prior to the COVID-19 complaining about not having money. Why not work at a grocery store? Pretty much every single one is hiring right now.
I encourage us all to refrain from hoarding consumable products, (eg. toilet paper, preserved food), so that enough is available for everyone. Supply is not diminished, so there's no need to artificially increase demand.

I've just been told by a staff member in .@Tesco that they are hiking their prices tonight - to discourage bulk buying!

At supermarket grab a plastic produce bag &amp;put their hand inside and use that to pick up something like a head of lettuce. Then drop it into another bag and seal it up. This way, 

youre not touching everyone elses produce &amp;sanitize shopping cart

There is no scarcity of essential commodities  milk, food items and medicine. So dont panic and go to stores @narendramodi said to Indian

Grocery stores are starting to temporarily change their policys in response to COVID-19. Here is what being affected: 

 If you bring your own reusable bags, YOU are expected to pack them 

 Cashless interaction

 Limiting store hours 

 Hour dedicated to at risk population

@moonbeamwishes Hey, Megan! We will work to keep our Clubs stocked and prices fair. As one would expect, paper products, cleaning supplies and other items are in high demand as Members prepare for the possible impact of COVID-19.
If I could self-quarantine I would. But people like me who work in grocery stores still have to work. I can't afford not to. Please be nice to us and be patient when the lines get long or if we can't help right away. #coronavirus #Quarantine #COVID19 #Retail

The last time I went to the grocery store, we had 15 cases of Covid-19 statewide. Schools were still open, my job was still open, stores has regular hours, and restaurants were still serving customers inside. 



That was only 6 days ago. Six y'all. Feels like an eternity ago.

Again, it's a super tough time to be in experimental consumer hardware. You're dealing with high R&amp;D costs and low margins already, new tariffs on top of that, and most recently, supply chain constraints with COVID-19.

Despite all that's going on with COVID-19, nature moves on, Spring is springing, and we have evidence that our hedgehogs are back in the garden after Winter. Food missing and some ? present. So happy! Just need to make sure we have plenty food for them now during the panic! ?

I work in a pharmacy. I'm physically &amp; mentally exhausted due to a 200% increase on scripts/items! We've had abuse due to price increase (on the odd occasion we had) paracetamol,hand gels,calpol,etc coz SUPPLIERS HAVE INCREASED THERE PRICES!! Who monitors them? #coronavirus #NHS https://t.co/lsnAaZ385j
1 2 Shops in Barking and Dagenham that have increased prices due to Covid 19 for gain and profit should be ashamed of themselves We are all in this together and should work together to keep each other safe and look after each other people are losing jobs incomes are affected
That way they can limit what people buy, instead of putting awareness posters up?



And maybe just invited the elderly and vulnerable into store.



Have most of the staff shopping rather than on the tills. I've done this before as a student, felt like supermarket sweep!

Please, as a retail worker in a food store, I beg you: Do not go shopping unless you really NEED to.



Our sales have doubled in the last week. This excessive buying is putting intense pressure on us and retail infrastructure as a whole.
We're in the early stages. If government doesn't financially support those in need, what do you think will happen when thousands run out of money? You won't have a grocery store left to shop at, even if you're fortunate enough to have an income. #COVIDCanada #Covid_19 #onpoli
Can we all act and shop responsibly and try to make sure that remains a health not shelf issue please think of others before picking up unnecessary duplicates

This pandemic had really exposed a lot outside the fact that apparently sales of TP coincide with consumer confidence. The amount of families depending on meals really needs to be visited.  Families and the working poor need support.  We are better than this. #Coronavirus

"a sweetener" - not the point, #Newsnight. If people can't afford rising food prices, they will loot rather than starve. And that means a breakdown of social distancing of the most radical kind #coronavirus
Good point - they are crying out for drivers, pickers and shop staff right now too. It would be good if they agreed to pay more than the minimum wage too, BTW, esp. given how some are using he #coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to raise prices. https://t.co/fmDCpyrvaK
Stores should enforce strict limits on sales. They should also help identify hoarders and those hoarders should have excess stockpiles confiscated without compensation. But that largely relies on a proactive govt, not Boris Johnson's #coronavirus #StopHoarding
I was going to say bread is an ideal '3-days supply' food as its often prepared in-store and is too perishable to stockpile - but nutcase hoarders have been bulk-buying even fruit, which has a similarly short shelflife #StopHoarding #coronavirus

To me the unsung heroes of this #Covid_19 crisis are the supermarket chains, their employees and their supply chains keeping food on the shelves. Some of the workers are doing twice the national working hours to help keep food and essentials available. Massive respect from me.

Today they were fully stocked. Completely stocked, all the eggs in the world.



#Capitalism is fucking awesome. #coronavirus
If youre social distancing, leaving the house for work, essentials or to exercise (maintaining a safe distance from others) is OK.



Going out unnecessarily or to socialise in groups of people is currently a bad idea.

The local sweet shop is selling toilet paper for cheap prices



It's gone too far
And on that note, why arent grocery store workers allowed, if not *required to wear protective gear?   They are in the crosshairs of this infection &amp; their safety is our safety.  #coronavirus #foodsafety #foodshortages
This covid-19 anxiety got me thinking.

It's a moment of truth for us to reflect on how much we mean to our employers.

Some have already paid April salaries in order for staff to stock food.

Others have given some kind of allowance.what has yours done?
We done people thanks to you all panic buying my brother who is disabled, didn't go food shopping because there is no food in the supermarket, soon he will run out of food, and I have to stay https://t.co/Hvf8e1qgRN so thank you everyone ??#CoronaCrisis

It's hard not to panic when grocery store shelves are empty.

When the government are encouraging social distancing we have businesses in encouraging travelling and holidays as the prices are cheap Shocking disregard to people can PCC advise them
Hey, World.  Just a friendly reminder:  when youre at the grocery store or picking up those curbside treats... BE KIND.  These people are risking their own safety to make sure you have what you need.  Smile, say thank you &amp; dont be an asshole.  #coronavirus #SocialDistanacing

At this point I'm pretty sure it's not COVID-19, but a case was confirmed at Castle Towers, which is a shopping centre down the road from my house and I'm there nearly every day. I also still had to travel out to uni on Monday before it changed to online. So im being careful

Dear Sir,

Belarus is doing nothing to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and honestly, our classes are still ongoing. Everyone still travels to work and uni and whatnot. The supermarket is still filled with people most days. President advised to take vodka to prevent, so I guess thats sth ?????
As usual, we complain that we're 'controlled' by a system but when given free choice, we make selfish decisions, thus requiring an authority to 'force' us into being kind. Essentially, we need rationing. By law. And now. #StopHoarding #coronavirus

There is no way we can prioritize the cage that has YOUR desired product on before any other stock delivery cage! After all how do we know when YOU are going to make an appearance? We try to do things as efficiently as possible #supermarket #coronavirus #COVID19
And yet we still see #customers rearranging the shelves and moving stock around the #supermarket. Please DONT! We have to move it back. Please be considerate. If we pick up your germs then who's going to fill the shelves when we're self-isolating? #coronavirus #COVID19
We work each cage of stock efficiently. We are NOT going to empty a complete #supermarket cage (1m x1m square by 2m high) onto the floor to get one product off the bottom of the cage because a customer HAS to have that item. #coronavirus #COVID19
Local cafe serves as Portuguese grocery store as well. Should they be open or closed? Can they still be open for takeaways? Numerous local food shops and takeaways can presumably remain open? If something is open for takeaways can you collect in person? #Covid_19

Advantages of the #CoronaCrisis 



Low gasoline prices like in the 80's.

Best time to get a Driving license.

Everyone has the same creditscore.

Truck prices drop to lower costs.

You're dream home is going to get lower than the 70's.

Kids they'll do anything for entertainment.
Seems like flour is this weeks panic purchase of choice, I guess it makes more sense than toilet paper but the irony is, there was loads of bread on the shelves. What part of "don't stock pile food" are people not getting? It's horrible carry on. #COVID19ireland #Covid_19

Just like in movies/shows, I've started to ration food - eating and drinking less, using less energy. I don't have enough $ to stock up or hoard. It's all good because now I'm actually considering it as intermittent fasting.

Lessons from COVID-19



Stock up food at home

Always reserve water for use

Have a structured and organized environment

Democracy isn't the best style of government

Keep enough money in your own care

Adopt cleanliness practices

Take life easy and short

Do your best when you can
In cases where clean, running water is not available, you can use a hand sanitizer but note that Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy.

Repeat.

Hand sanitizer is anti-bacterial

The #coronavirus is a virus 



A becteria and a virus is not the same. Wash your hands

Sanitizers will do nothing for the #cororonavirus.
First off, #coronavirus has an R0 of ~2. That means on average its transmitted by someone who is infected to two other people. Nothing to sneeze at (couldnt resist the pun), but if it was easier to pick up from community errands like grocery store runs R0 would be much higher.

Thinking about the advice I've seen to quarantine supermarket goods when you get home.
Absolute joke ! Supermarket staff still going to work long hours, how can Govt/Owners assuring were not getting in contact people who already have covid -19. Life is on risk for many like me. Ive 3 yr old wat if I get into contact, pass it on to him. Wholl be responsible?
I know that quarantine is essential for not spreading COVID-19 right now, but as an average retail worker, I don't get that choice. My store isn't closing.

To the woman biting her nails IN THE GROCERY STORE. Just, no!!! Nooo. From a former nail biter who has glorious pandemic nails right now ?? COVID-19 has changed the way I see nearly everything in life.
Y'all please stop obsessing over hand sanitizer. Plain ol soap and water works better (thanks, amphiphiles). Antibacterial soap is no better than regular soap (plus COVID-19 is a virus, not a bacteria). Don't let "99.9%" drive you to pay these outrageous prices. Just buy soap.

Its disgusting how @eBay allows sellers to take advantage of people in this #coronavirus #COVID19 pandemic. Prices for respirators and masks are close to $300.00. For those that really need it, God help them all. #EBay @3M

By slowing people down inside a #supermarket by #socialdistancing is going to increase the transmission rate of #coronavirus - the strategy is good for managing transmission during extended period of social contact (in a queue) and for managing footfall inside a public space...
By enforcing social distancing while moving through an aisle in a supermarket is actually going to cause more effective virus transmission as people waiting causes a higher chance of person coughing or sneezing into a crowd #coronavirus #covid19uk #covid19 #supermarkets

I told my Mom &amp; Dad that I'm getting tested tomorrow for COVID-19 because the manager of the grocery store told all employees that we should be tested. My Mom began to cry &amp; I tried to reassure her that I'd be okay. I didn't want my Mom &amp; Dad to worry if I tested positive
