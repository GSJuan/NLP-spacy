## Python programs to build the vocabulary, generate learning models, classify testing set and calculate classification error
### Programs implemented: 
  - python vocabulario.py  // Generates file vocabulario.txt containing all words from the COV_train.xlsx ass well as corpusP and corpusN files that contain the words inside positive and negative tweets, with repetitions, correspondingly.
  - python aprendizaje.py // Generates language model files (modelo_lenguaje_P o N) which contain the appearence probability of each word of the vocabulary in positive and negative class separately. They are generated using unknown words treatment as well ass laplacian smoothing
  - python clasificacion.py // Takes a set of tweets as testing input and for each tweet calculates the probability of it belonging to the positive and the negative class using the previously calculated probability of each word inside of the language models. Then, according to those probabilities, classifies each tweet in its corresponding class and dumps all that information in two files: resumen_aluXXX.txt and clasificacion_aluXXX.txt
  - python calculateError.py // simply opens the resumen file wich contains the simplified version of the clasification results and then compares those results with the actual tweet classification inside the original .xlsx file
 
### Transformations used:
  - Tokenization
  - Lower case everything
  - Delete punctuators and emojis
  - Delete hashtags, mentions, URLs and HTML tags
  - Lematization (Optional, it is calculated but not used)

### Libraries Used:
  - Spacy: used for tokenizing each tweet in the preprocessing phase as well as identifying stop words, punctuators and calculating the lemmatization of each token
  - NumPy: used for fast array indexation and included array operations (sort, unique ...)
  - Pandas: used for fast .xlsx loading into program and reliable data indexation
  - Collections: used for its useful Counter object, which when given an array, generates an object of "key value" pairs where "key" is the word inside the array and "value" is the number of repetitions of that word inside of the array.

### Calculated error over training Corpus
My model was able to achieve a 82.28% of accuracy when tested with the training corpus,
