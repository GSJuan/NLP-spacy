Me, ready to go at supermarket during the #COVID19 outbreak.



Not because I'm paranoid, but because my food stock is litteraly empty. The #coronavirus is a serious thing, but please, don't panic. It causes shortage...

For corona prevention,we should stop to buy things with the cash and should use online payment methods because corona can spread through the notes. Also we should prefer online shopping from our home. It's time to fight against COVID 19?. #govindia #IndiaFightsCorona

@BobJLowe Sadly those are the misinformed thinking that COVID-19 gives diarrhoea, therefore they had to stock-pile toilet papers. ? ATM, hygiene and food are more important.

I'm at work yesterday (Retail store) and a customer I was cashing out who desperately needed long brown chic boots said to me "I can't believe your boss hasn't closed and you're work during this time " well bitch it's because people like you who are out we can't close

Retail is absolutely nuts right now. The virus is one, but so many additional problems are going to be caused by peoples behaviour. #StopPanicBuying #coronavirus
@StateBank_Pak Decent decision in the wake of deceleration in prices. But surprising to see @StateBank_Pak weak stance/statement on fiscal slippages.

Cant believe Ive just gone to order my tesco online shopping and there isnt a single pack of fresh chicken! Along with pasta, toilet roll, hand soap and more! Cant believe how #Coronavirus has shown such an grotesque side of society! Greedy selfish bastards! #coronavirusuk
While everyone panic about the food during restrictions of movement (bcuz of covid-19), I'm worried about my studies problems ?
Lockdown, day 4: Going to the supermarket. It took me 5 days to go outside because I had enough food. My town #santapola?? looks a ghost village. ? I feel in a horror film but it's quite real.

To those buying up baby wipes, formula amid the Covid-19 panic; leave these items for the babies. No mother should have to worry about having enough food their infant can tolerate because someone afraid of running out of milk for a week decided it was an appropriate substitute.
@PresidencyZA what are you doing to stop these ridiculous prices increases on these essential items (hand sanitizers, masks, etc) #Covid_19 @Abramjee
People are just selfish, Stop stock piling food, people like me who are trying to buy stuff normally cannot find essentials to make our dinner with, important part of a chilli is mince, but can I find any on the shelf in any shop #coronavirus #selfish

Ok so with so much going around about covid 19, i've been told people with asthma need to self isolate for 12 weeks, is this correct?I'm 22 and I work in a supermarket so constantly around people. i cant afford to self isolate but also don't want to put myself and others at risk?
I can kind of see how this panic buying thing takes hold.. I have resisted so far (mainly because I can't afford a lot) but a part of me does want to go buy a bunch of food in case there is none left when I run out. #coronavirus #COVID19au #panickbuying

yo but fr this covid 19 panic is making me start to panic i ate so much less dinner cos theres no food at the supermarket and theres 6 people in my house 6 people to feed and one of them is vegan which makes me so stressed
#coronavirus #Coronabelgie not such a big fan of limiting access to food shops. This measure is going to fuel the panic, hoarding is going to get much much worse. A better rule would be to limit purchasing per citizen, and increase opening hours.

Every time a supermarket put a 3 for 2 offer on a product, encouraging folk to consume 3 when they'd otherwise have taken 1, they lost credibility in the fight against people over-buying at a time of existential threat to themselves and their families.

day 10 the queues to get into supermarkets one at a time are getting longer Are more people starting to dare to come out or are they running out of the food they stockpiled in a panic
It s really crazy that everyone is overreacting and stockpiling without realizing they re leaving nothing for those who need it I can t buy in bulk like you can Ration what you buy please you don t need the whole damn selection
My main question with is how much food is going to be wasted It s not like the people panic buying food are just buying canned and long life foods they are even buying up all the fruit and veg

 is using over the past few days is dangerous &amp; causing panic. There is no reason to discuss rationing food. We are essentially on lock down as it is in NYC. #NYC #deBlasio #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaVirus
Panic buying food online leads to larger orders being placed, which means fewer customers can be serviced on each route, which then fuels more panic buying  ...

It seems to me that people are not taking this Chinese oriented Covid 19 coronavirus seriously! especially at 7 elevens here in Orlando or at the publics grocery store from what I witnessed. (College Park)
I know when I shop later, the state of the supermarket and selfishness of the stockpilers is going to get to me. Really making me question if there can be an AFTERLIFE when so many are acting so selfishly. And it's not a minority.

#coronavirus As someone who works in a supermarket I can speak on behalf of everyone when I say it is absolute chaos Please don't be disrespectful to staff. The other day I was threatened by two men telling me how they are going to raid our store and I should not get in there way
If youre a panic buyer who purchased stupid amounts of food and soap leaving none for the others then you are a selfish fucking wanker and bad things should happen to you. 



And thank you to all the NHS superheroes ?? legends.

As i have never been so worried about running out of food and empty supermarket shelves, i have also never eaten so much and so many snacks. #coronavirus #Covid_19 #COVID
Looking at supermarket shelves were in for a lot worse than the Carona virus as it seems the whole female population of Boro's menstrual cycles have synced ??? #stockpiling #coronavirus
Milano the line for getting in the supermarket no more than 10 people at the same time They are waiting at 2 arm distance 19
If I were a retailer and my shop was filled with crowds of morons each trying to buy 1,000 rolls of toilet paper, then of course I'd jack up the prices...



...And you know what? Fuck you if you have a problem with that! #coronavirus
Surely the answer to #Covid_19 panic shopping isnt to reduce supermarket hours meaning the same amount of people cram in a smaller amount of time, but to just put a limit of 2 or 3x items per person. Seems the complete wrong way to go. #panicbuying
I hate this. Soft-headed neurotypicals are booking delivery slots because they fear "getting the coroma" from "the gas cloud of death." Except disabled people who NEED online shopping now can't do it thanks to these mouth-breathing imbeciles. #Covid_19 #CoronaCrisis #Coronavirus
Do you remember when after hurricane Maria airlines increased the prices of tickets to exorbitant amounts? I dont feel sorry for them. Disaster can hit anyone, at any moment. No one is exempted. Just like with death. #sorrynotsorry #PuertoRico #Covid_19
New #coronavirus rule: If you manhandle a fruit or vegetable at the grocery store for more than 3 seconds, that shit is yours. Do not put it back.
Tearful critical care nurse unable to buy food after 48hr shift begs UK Stop stockpiling
#coronavirus I have to say that I'm scared about the people who aren't scared. I was in a Zoom this morning and a woman said she goes to the grocery store every day because it's the only place to go! But the point is to stay home and stay away from people, not hang out w/ folks.
@cojojonudo @BorisJohnson People are scared but Italy manages to keep shops stocked. #Stockpiling must be curbed. Food banks stocked up and baby food handed out maybe in local pharmacies who know local families. Crazy panic buying! #CoronaCrisis
@CTFCLinda @Morrisons @Jaammmiiieeee Couldn't think of anything worse than being on minimum wage in a supermarket with dickheads of customers pilling their trolley with pasta and bog rolls. #Covid_19

When all the grocery store associates become sick or dont come to work due to being afraid of the #coronavirus a few things might happen, more people will use self checkout, which will makes lines go slower due to lack of self check lanes.
Officially one week in #selfquarantine. Heres a recap:

-naps, so many naps 

-new game: cold or COVID-19?

-more naps

-online shopping

-snacks, so many snacks

-breaking news every 5 minutes

-a few more naps



Heres to another month of isolation!

Selfish panic-buyers have stripped UK supermarket shelves bare.



Do you think people have the right to hoard?



#StopHoarding #CoronaCrisis
We are rightly focussed on covid-19 and stressed by empty supermarket shelves, profiteering and the vulnerability of our elderly parents. Avoid the queues and a trip to the shops https://t.co/wwp6nkitun, https://t.co/sIHTe9i6Hi
So far I have panic bought: 2 bags of dog food, 2 bags of cat food, the entire series of The Vampire Diaries and 2, 10 ice cream cakes from DQ. #COVIDCanada #Covid_19
@HillaryClinton Why don't you, Bill, and Chelsea march your assess into a supermarket to volunteer to restock shelves? 



Stop being a blight. 



#coronavirus
Everyone can choose whichever option they want, go out, stay in, socially distance yourself, cuddle up if you want!! But if you get sick, if your family or friends die maybe youll ask whether that pint or queuing at the supermarket for toilet rolls was worth it. #CoronaVirus
So those #panicbuying food due to #coronavirus are now, according to a customer who works in a nearby Argos, panic buying freezers now to deal with their #foodhoard!



If they can afford second freezers, then surely they have no need to buy extra food, no? #Selfish #StopHoarding

There are no slots for @waitrose online shopping available until the end of June?????? I am lost for words. #CoronaCrisis #coronavirus this takes #panicbuying to a new level.
My husband is a FedEx driver, and Im shocked by how many people he says still answer the door. If a FedEx, UPS, or USPS person knocks, just let them leave the package outside. Signatures are not currently required. Wave through a window or say hi through the closed door, FFS.

Not sure who is annoying me more at the moment. The people who are going out panic buying for no reason as food shops aren't going to shut and will still get deliveries or those who are trying to make money from coronavirus by selling products at increased prices! ? #coronavirus

All coronavirus has shown is actually how selfish people really are... all this panic and bulk buying. The unwillingness to stop going out and minimising the risk of spread. Going to work doesnt count as people still need to put food on the table for their family. #Covid_19
Question:



If someone is infected with #Covid_19 and they dont know it yet -b/c of the 2-27 day incubation lag- or theyre asymptomatic and theyre stocking the shelves at a grocery store, doesnt that present a problem and kind of defeat the purpose of quarantine?????

These are unprecedented times. Over 150 colleagues &amp; I are calling for the Business Sec &amp; retailers to do whatever it takes to ensure no one is left behind #COVID19 https://t.co/dZz0Ijgp00
@JonesPedantic @billkinkle Me too. This is an old generic medication. I am appalled. I was told today that 90 days will cost me almost $600 if they can find it because my insurance will only cover one month.  It is usually about $40 per month.
Well done Sainsbury s in Shenley Milton Keynes telling customers only one item from each product range Store was more relaxed less people no stress or bad behaviour This is what we need to see across the food retail sector to end panic buying amp hoarding 19
Left the house at 7:45 to go to the store to stock up to get some food and essentials. Clearly everyone in Long Island had the same idea. I got the last 2 cases of 40 pack water and the death stares I got were terrifying. Had to hurry up and come out. #Covid_19
Thing I just said to Middle Brother: "We're going to the grocery store to see if we can find milk." I refuse to let panic take over my life, but we have to acknowledge life is weird right now. That from a place where life is still relatively unchanged thus far.  #Covid_19

Given the mass no-deal stockpiling efforts by businesses across the UK over the past 12 months, I wonder what state our supermarket supply chains would be in during this COVID-19 panic-buying exercise, had we not had to prepare for a no-deal Brexit...
To hear that there is the possibility of food rationing coming up infuriates. In this age of plenty , can we just be a little bit less ignorant with all this panic buying ? #DontPanicBuy #BeKind  #Covid_19

COVID-19, has just over 1,372 cases in the UK, and 35 deaths

I strongly suspect there isn't actually much panic buying or hoarding in the way we imagine. Supermarkets in the UK took £193.4bn in revenue in 2019, which is £3.7bn/week. £1bn extra has been added over 3 weeks: approx 10% rise per week for 3 weeks. That's small, give that...
This whole stay indoors or no gathering is stupid. If you go to the supermarket thats now the biggest gathering happening right now so really not stopping this #coronavirus #Covid_19

We know COVID-19 can survive for days on surfaces, but the one place everyone needs to go is the supermarket. One person coughing (or an asymptomatic person touching stuff) could spread contamination (although it's MOSTLY spread through direct contact with an infected person).

In recent weeks, despite billions in Trump tax breaks and subsidies, oil and gas stock prices have been plummeting as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

My simple solution would be to remove all trolleys and baskets from every supermarket, in addition to restricting one type of item person.



This means that you can only buy what you can hold in your arms and only one of each item



Is this too simple??

Went to #Publix supermarket yesterday.  No one, not even workers, wearing masks.  Everyone pushing to be in line or to get meat.  No social distancing.  Nothing to stop the spread and this is a county where people have died.  #coronavirus @LiveFunTravel1
When you empty the supermarket shelves meaning they are forced to close early... think about all the staff who are havig their shifts and therefore their wages cut short. 



Think about that and then do better.

Dear Readers,



The magnitude of misinformation spreading in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming our small team. Were seeing scores of people, in a rush to find any comfort, make things worse as they share (sometimes dangerous) misinformation.

In a panic, that excess will drop, however, as long as the supply chain holds, the shelves get restocked.

Hunger(lack of food supplies)and famine are becoming a major concern and creating chaos in some countries where demand for food is skyrocketing, in poor countries people are more afraid of famine than the so called covid-19 pandemic disease.
With: rising prices of major foods in many countries, high rates of inflation, falling productivity, decreasing imported goods, rapid spread of covid-19, closure of borders, worsening international trade crisis, economists predict that the worst is yet to come!
Does anyone else feel confused by the market's rise? ?

If were the govt, I'd lift the restrictions but also close down all the Covid-19 treatment centres and sell all the ventilators/PPE at market prices. Go out - fall sick - treat yourself.

Fintwits keep talking &amp; comparing previous eras. The chatter has not been valuable/reliable. The economic shutdowns from COVID-19 define this era. No other era has the same pandemic=crash factors. Unlike ever before, a medical remedy/vaccine will immensely redefine asset prices

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on demand for Frances black #truffles in 2019-20 can perhaps be seen towards the end of the season when #truffle prices did not rise as sharply as the usual seasonal pattern. https://t.co/GlvOkPJTf1
Black #truffles sales were at a low in Frances regional markets in 2019-20. The COVID-19 outbreak may have been a factor, though truffle prices were high. Climate change is causing French truffle production to decline over the longer term  see Environ. Res. Lett. 14 (2019). https://t.co/4LdF12kb9m

Global demand is plummeting because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and reduced supply will still not bring oil prices up to last year's levels. India should move to fill up its strategic petroleum reserves while prices are low. https://t.co/av02jzF1Dw

With @Topps &amp; @PaniniAmerica shutting down production due to COVID-19, I find it concerning &amp; disappointing that a number of distributors are significantly increasing the prices on their products.



While I get supply &amp; demand, it seems close to, if not, COVID-19 price gauging.
